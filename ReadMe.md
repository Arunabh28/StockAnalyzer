# Stock Analyzer
All big US investors or fund managers are required to file form 13F. SEC has a defined XML schema which is used for the filing. This is a quarterly filing.

The goal of the tool is to provide necessary insight so that small investors can take a clue from the investment pattern of big investors and make an informed decision. Due to the daily changing market, a quarter might be too late.
